# Research Workflows

Complete end-to-end workflows for common bioinformatics and aging research tasks.

## Available Workflows

Workflows will be documented here as they are developed, including:

- GWAS analysis pipeline
- Protein structure prediction and docking
- RNA-seq differential expression
- Virtual drug screening
- Literature review automation

Each workflow includes step-by-step instructions, example data, and expected outputs.
