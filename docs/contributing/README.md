# Contributing to Bio-ClaudeCode

We welcome contributions that enhance agent capabilities and add new research workflows.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Adding New Agents

Agents should focus on domain expertise rather than simple API wrappers. Include comprehensive documentation of capabilities, example workflows, and scientific context.

### Code Standards

- Python code follows PEP 8
- All code includes type hints
- Statistical analyses report effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Visualizations follow scientific figure best practices
- All methods cite relevant papers

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Example data included for validation
- Performance benchmarks where appropriate

### Documentation

- Clear usage examples
- Scientific background and context
- Citations for methods and algorithms
- Known limitations and edge cases
